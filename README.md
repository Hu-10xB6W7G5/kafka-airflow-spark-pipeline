# kafka-airflow-spark-pipeline
Text-to-speech data collection with Kafka, Airflow, and Spark.

## Project overview

In this project design and build a robust, large scale, fault tolerant, highly available Kafka cluster that can be used to post a sentence and receive an audio file and produce a tool that can be deployed to process posting and receiving text and audio files from and into a data lake, apply transformation in a distributed manner, and load it into a warehouse in a suitable format to train a speech-t0-text model.
